# ACNHMobileSpawner

Item injector for Animal Crossing: New Horizons for mobile built in Unity. 
Requires a Switch running [Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere) if using the background service, with the plugin [sys-botbase](https://github.com/olliz0r/sys-botbase) or [USB-Botbase](https://github.com/fishguy6564/USB-Botbase) installed.

Refer to the Wiki for more information on [using USB-Botbase](https://github.com/berichan/ACNHMobileSpawner/wiki/USB-botbase)

Based heavily on [NHSE](https://github.com/kwsch/NHSE).

### Android builds

The application requires an Android device running at minimum Android 4.4 (KitKat) with support for OpenGLES2.

Builds are not guaranteed to be stable and you run them at your own risk. You may download the [apk files here](https://github.com/berichan/ACNHMobileSpawner/releases).

### iOS builds

I will try to build iOS .ipa files if there is enough interest in this.

### Notes

Some code was deleted and had to be rebuilt using ILSpy. I've done my best to clean up the classes affected, but they will be uncommented, minus ILSpy warnings I've kept in just to know what was affected.
